Some files were omitted from this library as I do not have permission to repost some of the work used in the program, though the fundamental parts of the program are there still.

Some files that were omitted were the 3d model obj files, texture files and a Utilities class that was not written by me, but rarely used.

Created with the use of JOML and JOGL libraries.
